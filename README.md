# Cows-and-Goats-Microbiota
Metatranscriptomic data analysis pipeline

This repository contains the scripts used in:

Corral-Jara et al.
"Species-specific rumen microbial responses to dietary inhibition of methanogenesis in cows and goats"


## Workflow

The analysis consists of five main steps:

1. Differential occurrence analysis (DESeq2)
2. Co-occurrence network construction (ccrepe)
3. Cluster identification (K-means)
4. KEGG pathway integration (KEGGREST)
5. PLS analyses and variable selection (mixOmics)

## Software

Analyses were performed in:

- R version 4.4.1.
- DESeq2
- ccrepe
- igraph
- mixOmics
- KEGGREST
- dplyr
- plyr
- data.table

Package versions are reported in:

sessionInfo.txt
